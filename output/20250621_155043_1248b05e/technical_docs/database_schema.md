**VLC Database Schema Documentation**
=====================================

## 1. Database Overview and Technology Used
------------------------------------------

The VLC project does not appear to utilize a traditional database management system. Instead, it seems to rely on Python and JavaScript files for its functionality. As a result, there is no database schema to document in the classical sense.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that a database schema could be designed to support the VLC project's functionality.

## 2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Description
-----------------------------------------------

Based on the provided code analysis, it is challenging to create an accurate ERD. Nevertheless, we can propose a high-level ERD that might represent the VLC project's data structure.

The proposed ERD could include entities such as:

*   **Media Files**: representing audio and video files
*   **Playlists**: representing collections of media files
*   **Users**: representing users of the VLC application

These entities could have relationships such as:

*   A user can have multiple playlists (one-to-many).
*   A playlist can contain multiple media files (one-to-many).

## 3. Table Definitions with Columns, Data Types, and Constraints
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a sample table definition for the proposed entities:

### Media Files Table

| Column Name | Data Type | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `int` | Unique identifier for the media file | Primary Key |
| `title` | `varchar(255)` | Title of the media file | Not Null |
| `file_path` | `varchar(255)` | File path of the media file | Not Null |
| `file_type` | `varchar(10)` | Type of the media file (e.g., video, audio) | Not Null |

### Playlists Table

| Column Name | Data Type | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `int` | Unique identifier for the playlist | Primary Key |
| `name` | `varchar(255)` | Name of the playlist | Not Null |
| `user_id` | `int` | Foreign key referencing the Users table | Foreign Key |

### Users Table

| Column Name | Data Type | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `int` | Unique identifier for the user | Primary Key |
| `username` | `varchar(255)` | Username chosen by the user | Not Null |
| `password` | `varchar(255)` | Password for the user | Not Null |

## 4. Relationships Between Tables
---------------------------------

The relationships between tables are as follows:

*   A user can have multiple playlists (one-to-many).
*   A playlist is associated with one user (many-to-one).
*   A playlist can contain multiple media files (one-to-many).
*   A media file can be part of multiple playlists (many-to-many).

## 5. Indexes and Performance Considerations
---------------------------------------------

To improve query performance, indexes could be created on the following columns:

*   `Media Files`.`file_path`
*   `Playlists`.`name`
*   `Users`.`username`

## 6. Data Migration Strategies
-------------------------------

Since there is no existing database schema, data migration strategies would involve creating a new database schema and populating it with data from the VLC project's existing data sources.

## 7. Backup and Recovery Procedures
--------------------------------------

Backup and recovery procedures would involve:

*   Regularly backing up the database to a secure location
*   Implementing database replication for redundancy
*   Creating a disaster recovery plan to restore the database in case of data loss

Here is a sample SQL script to create the proposed tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE MediaFiles (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Playlists (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE PlaylistMediaFiles (
    playlist_id INT,
    media_file_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (playlist_id, media_file_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (playlist_id) REFERENCES Playlists(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (media_file_id) REFERENCES MediaFiles(id)
);
```

Note that this is a simplified example and may not accurately represent the VLC project's actual database schema or requirements.
