**VLC API Documentation**
==========================

**Overview**
------------

The VLC API is a general-purpose API for interacting with the VLC media player. This API provides endpoints for controlling the media player, accessing media files, and retrieving information about the player's state.

**Authentication Methods**
-------------------------

The VLC API does not require authentication for most endpoints. However, some endpoints may require a valid session ID, which can be obtained by logging in to the VLC web interface.
